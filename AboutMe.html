            I am currently a junior at Northwestern University majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Economics, and I will be studying abroad in Edinburgh throughout fall 2017. I was born in Venezuela but have lived in the U.S. for 14 years. I love getting to meet new people and learning about new cultures. I also value learning new skills, helping others grow, and building meaningful relationships with the people I work with.<br><br>

Having just completed the intro sequence, I'm currently in the process of figuring out the exact area of Computer Science that I'm interested in. However, I'd like to focus my work on seeing how technology solutions could be used to help reduce income inequality and poverty throughout the U.S.<br><br>
              When I'm not in the library doing homework, I like to spend my free time hanging out with friends,
              going to downtown Chicago, reading, and playing video games.<br> <br>


              Recent Reads: Royal Assassin (Robin Hobb), The Wise Man's Fear (Patrick Rothfuss), The Given Day (Dennis Lehane) <br> <br>

              Recent Games Played: Wolfenstein: The New Oder, Horizon Zero Dawn, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter <br><br>

              I think that seeing what kind of
              music a person listens to can really help you get to know them, so I've compiled a little Spotify playlist of my
              favorite songs at the moment.  <br> <br> If you want to get in touch, feel free to reach out to me at
